We have created our mvn project that will include our java code and
junit testing for the peer evaluation project. By the end of our
project, we should have working code that creates confidential 
evaluations for students to take of other peers that will give
the teachers feedback on their students. It should also have junit testing
that accurately tests the code we have written. We also have our domain UML
model which shows the relationships between all of the different classes.
