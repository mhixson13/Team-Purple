Peer Evaluation Project

In our project, users can enter their credentials to login to the main menu. If the user is mrblee, we will provide mrblee with a html statistics report on the entire class of student evaluations. Mrblee can also see the Extreme level of each student and the standard deviations per student per category. Other students can also generate a report for their own scores, but all the ratings are shown as anonymous to provide confidentiality. Authorized users can also choose to insert .csv files, or select the option to quit.

This project can be run by using commands:
javac -cp ".:postgresql-42.3.3.jar"  evaluation.java
java -cp postgresql-42.3.3.jar evaluation.java
