What are my strengths and how can I contribute?

I am very good at organization, problem solving, doing research, and 
cleaning things up. 

I can contribute to the team in each of these ways.
I can make sure we stay organized with our folders in the repo, I can help
figure out why code isn't working, and find more efficient ways of
approaching problems. I can also do research to gain more knowledge on our
project, and I can also help with debugging and making sure our code is clean.we
